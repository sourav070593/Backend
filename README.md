Hi,

I have created:

*Created a POST request that accepts the following student details: student ID , Student name, GPA. 
*Used postman to make these requests and populate the storage. 
*Created another GET request that retrieves the data of a particular student.
*Created an endpoint that looks for the topper among the class.

URL:
http://localhost:3000/students           (All Students)
http://localhost:3000/students/101       (Unique Id)
http://localhost:3000/topper             (Topper)
